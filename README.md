# Sparta Sinatra Group Project

As a group we were tasked with creating a full stack web application which stores and displays Spartans' information. Users of this application can navigate through the following pages: users, roles, cohorts and specialisation; users have different permissions depending on their role, those who are admins are capable of full CRUD functionionality such as adding, deleting and editing users. 

Using Sinatra and following the MVC (models, views and controller) structure we utilised the seven restful routes in order to create a fully functional website. We also used HTML, CSS, bootstrap and Javascript (JQuery).
